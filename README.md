Improving Netflix Recommendations Using Ensemble Models  and Web Scraping

### Overview
Recommendation systems play a pivotal role in providing personalized content to users in the digital media landscape. However, the increasing volume and variety of available content present challenges for these systems in terms of maintaining high prediction accuracy and user satisfaction. 

Our project aims to tackle the issue of enhancing a movie recommendation system by incorporating additional metadata from external sources, such as IMDB, and integrating deep learning techniques. We will explore whether these advanced methods can yield more accurate predictions and better user satisfaction across various domains than traditional techniques.
